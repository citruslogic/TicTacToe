# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe library that can be used anywhere.

## Assumptions

1. The board has control determining the winner instead of the player or the main program. 
2. Strings are returned as status messages to the program using Board. 
3. Draw() should be boolean because after the other three conditions for winning a draw can be determined. 
4. The board is an array type instead of a Vector. 
5. The board does not have an undo feature; game state cannot be replayed.
